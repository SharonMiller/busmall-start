From Marketing Research Team:
The marketing and research team is looking for a clean and easy to navigate site so that their focus group is easily able to select their favorite photos. The end goal is to be able to narrow down the favorite photos, so that they can be used effectively in the final print copy of the Bus Mall magazine. 

From Developer:
As a developer I want to plan my project in advance. To plan out the structure and scaffolding of the HTML page so that I am not missing any parts and I know what is needed next. I want to work on the JS bit by bit so that it is not overwhelming. I want to test that one part is working before moving on to the next part and anticipate future steps so I do not end up with spaghetti code. 

I want to have a click counter
I want three even photos
I want the photos to be randomized to keep the voting unbiased



From Focus group participant: 
Our focus group wants to be able to easily navigate the page, know exactly what they are supposed to do as far as clicking on the radio button that corrisponds with thier favorite image then clicking submit vote. Then after 25 votes they see their results. The photos should be easy to see and vote on, the instructions should be clear.
